					<li> <b>Meta-analysis</b><br>
						Often the results for the same intervention differ across clinical trials and it may not be 
						clear whether one therapy provides more benefit than another. As CER increases and more 
						studies are conducted, clinicians and policymakers are more likely to encounter this scenario.
						In a systematic review, a researcher identifies similar studies and displays their results 
						in a table, enabling qualitative comparisons across the studies. With a meta-analysis, 
						the data from included studies are statistically combined into a single “result.” Merging 
						the data from a number of studies increases the effective sample size of the investigation, 
						providing a statistically stronger conclusion about the body of research. By so doing, 
						investigators may detect low frequency events and demonstrate more subtle distinctions 
						between therapeutic alternatives. <br>

						When studies have been properly identified and combined, the meta-analysis produces a 
						summary estimate of the findings and a confidence interval that can serve as a benchmark 
						in medical opinion and practice. However, when done incorrectly, the quantitative and 
						statistical analysis can create impressive “numbers” but biased results. The following are 
						important criteria for properly conducted meta-analyses:

						<ul> 
							<li> Carefully defining unbiased inclusion or exclusion criteria for study selection.</li>
							<li> Including only those studies that have similar design elements, such as patient 
								population, drug regimen, outcomes being assessed, and timeframe.</li>
							<li> Applying correct statistical methods to combine and analyze the data.</li>
						</ul>

						Reporting this information is essential for the reader to determine whether the data were 
						suitable to combine, and if the meta-analysis draws unbiased conclusions. Meta-analyses of 
						randomized clinical trials are considered to be the highest level of medical evidence as 
						they are based upon a synthesis of rigorously controlled trials that systematically reduce 
						bias and confounding. This technique is useful in summarizing available evidence and will 
						likely become more common in the era of publicly funded comparative effectiveness research. 
						The following case study will examine several key principles that will be useful as the 
						reader encounters these publications.</li><br>

					<li> <b>Clinical Application</b><br>
						Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, resulting in 
						approximately 20% of all deaths. Diabetics are particularly susceptible to heart disease, 
						with more than 65% of deaths attributable to it. The nonfatal complications of diabetes 
						are wide-ranging and include kidney failure, nerve damage, amputation, stroke and blindness, 
						among other outcomes. In 2007, the total estimated cost of diabetes in the United States 
						was $174B; $116B was derived from direct medical expenditures and the rest from the 
						indirect cost of lost productivity due to the disease. With such serious health effects 
						and heavy direct and indirect costs tied to diabetes, proper disease management is critical. 
						Historically, diabetes treatment has focused on strict blood sugar control, assuming 
						that this goal not only targets diabetes but also reduces other serious comorbidities 
						of the disease. <br>

						Anti-diabetic agents have long been associated with key questions as to their benefits/risks 
						in the treatment of diabetes. The sulfonylurea tolbutamide, a first generation anti-diabetic 
						drug, was found in a landmark study in the 1970s to significantly increase the CV mortality 
						rate compared to patients not on this agent. Further analysis by external parties concluded 
						that the methods employed in this trial were significantly flawed (e.g., use of an “arbitrary” 
						definition of diabetes status, heterogeneous baseline characteristics of the populations studied, 
						and incorrect statistical methods). Since these early studies, CV concerns continue to be an 
						issue with selected oral hypoglycemic agents that have subsequently entered the marketplace.<br>

						A class of drugs, thiazolidinedione (TZD), was approved in the late 1990s, as a solution to the 
						problems associated with the older generation of sulfonylureas. Rosiglitazone, a member of the 
						TZD class, was approved by the FDA in 1999 and was widely prescribed for the treatment of 
						type-2 diabetes. A number of RCTs supported the benefit of rosiglitazone as an important new 
						oral antidiabetic agent. However, safety concerns developed as the FDA received reports of 
						adverse cardiac events potentially associated with rosiglitazone. It was in this setting that a 
						meta-analysis by Nissen and Wolski was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June 2007.
						</li><br>

					<li> <b>What was done?</b><br>
						Nissen and Wolski conducted a meta-analysis examining the impact of rosiglitazone on 
						cardiac events and mortality compared to alternative therapeutic approaches. The study 
						began with a broad search to locate potential studies for review. The authors screened 
						published phase II, III, and IV trials; the FDA website; and the drug manufacturer’s 
						clinical-trial registry for applicable data relating to rosiglitazone use. When the 
						initial search was complete, the studies were further categorized by pre-stated inclusion 
						criteria. Meta-analysis inclusion criteria were simple: studies had to include rosiglitazone 
						and a randomized comparator group treated with either another drug or placebo, study arms 
						had to show similar length of treatment, and all groups had to have received more than 24 
						weeks of exposure to the study drugs. The studies had to contain outcome data of interest 
						including the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) or death from all CV causes. Out of 116 
						studies surveyed by the authors, 42 met their inclusion criteria and were included in the 
						meta-analysis. Of the studies they included, 23 had durations of 26 weeks or less, and only 
						five studies followed patients for more than a year. Until this point, the study’s authors
						were following a path similar to that of any reviewer interested in CV outcomes, examining 
						the results of these 42 studies and comparing them qualitatively. Quantitatively combining
						the data, however, required the authors to make choices about the studies they could merge 
						and the statistical methods they should apply for analysis. Those decisions greatly influenced
						the results that were reported.
						</li><br>

					<li> <b>What was found?</b><br>
						When the studies were combined, the meta-analysis contained data from 15,565 patients in 
						the rosiglitazone group and 12,282 patients as comparators. Analyzing their data, the 
						authors chose one particular statistical method (the Peto odds ratio method, a fixed-effect 
						statistical approach), which calculates the odds of events occurring where the outcomes of
						interest are rare and small in number. In comparing rosiglitazone with a “control” group 
						that included other drugs or placebo, the authors reported odds ratios of 1.43 (95% CI, 
						1.03-1.98; P=0.03) and 1.64 (95% CI, 0.98-2.74; P=0.06) for MI and death from CV causes, 
						respectively. In other words, the odds of an MI or death from a CV cause are higher for 
						rosiglitazone patients than for patients on other therapies or placebo. The authors 
						reported that rosiglitazone was significantly associated with an increase in the risk of 
						MI and had borderline significance in increasing the risk of death from all CV causes. 
						These findings appeared online on the same day that the FDA issued a safety alert 
						regarding rosiglitazone. Discussion of the meta-analysis was immediately featured 
						prominently in the news media. By December 2007, prescription claims for the drug at 
						retail pharmacies had fallen by more than 50%.<br>

						As diabetic patients and their clinicians reacted to the news, a methodologic debate also 
						ensued. This discussion included statistical issues pertaining to the conduct of the analysis,
						its implications for clinical care, and finally the FDA and drug manufacturer’s roles in 
						overseeing and regulating rosiglitazone. The concern among patients with diabetes regarding 
						treatment, continues in the medical community today.</li><br>

					<li> <b>Was this the right answer?</b><br>
						Should the studies have been combined? Commentators faulted the authors for including several
						studies that were not originally intended to investigate diabetes, and for combining both 
						placebo and drug therapy data into one comparator arm. Some critics noted that despite the 
						stated inclusion criteria, some data were derived from studies where the rosiglitazone 
						arm was allowed a longer follow-up than the comparator arm. By failing to account for 
						this longer follow-up period, commentators felt that the authors may have overestimated 
						the effect of rosiglitazone on CV outcomes. Many reviewers were concerned that this 
						meta-analysis excluded trials in which no patients suffered an MI or died from CV causes
						- the outcomes of greatest interest. Some reviewers also noted that the exclusion of 
						zero-event trials from the pooled dataset not only gave an incomplete picture of the 
						impact of rosiglitazone but could have increased the odds ratio estimate. In general, 
						the pooled dataset was criticized by many for being a faulty microcosm of the information 
						available regarding rosiglitazone.<br>

						It is essential that a meta-analysis be based on similarity in the data sources. If studies 
						differ in important areas such as the patient populations, interventions, or outcomes, 
						combining their data may not be suitable. The researchers accepted studies and populations 
						that were clinically heterogeneous, yet pooled them as if they were not. The study reported 
						that the results were combined from a number of trials that were not initially intended to 
						investigate CV outcomes. Furthermore, the available data did not allow for time-to-event 
						analysis, an essential tool in comparing the impact of alternative treatment options. 
						Reviewers considered the data to be insufficiently homogeneous, and the line of cause and 
						effect to be murkier than the authors described.</li><br>

					<li> <b>Were the statistical methods optimal?</b><br>
						The statistical methods for this meta-analysis also came under significant criticism. 
						The critiques focused on the authors’ use of the Peto method as being an incorrect choice 
						because data were pooled from both small and very large studies, resulting in a potential 
						overestimation of treatment effect. Others reviewers pointed that the Peto method should 
						not have been used, as a number of the underlying studies did not have patients assigned 
						equally to rosiglitazone and comparator groups. Finally, critics suggested that the 
						heterogeneity of the included studies required an altogether different set of analytic 
						techniques. <br>

						Demonstrating the sensitivity of the authors’ initial analysis to the inclusion criteria and 
						statistical tests used, a number of researchers reworked the data from this study. One 
						researcher used the same studies but analyzed the data with a more commonly used statistical 
						method (Mantel-Haenszel), and found no significant increase in the relative risk or common 
						odds ratio with MI or CV death. When the pool of studies was expanded to include those 
						originally eliminated because they had zero CV events, the odds ratios for MI and death from 
						CV causes dropped from 1.43 to 1.26 (95% CI, 0.93-1.72) and from 1.64 to 1.14 
						(95% CI, 0.74-1.74), respectively. Neither of the recalculated odd ratios were significant 
						for MI or CV death. Finally, several newer long-term studies have been published since the 
						Nissen meta-analysis. Incorporating their results with the meta-analysis data showed 
						that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of MI but not of CV death. 
						Thus, the findings from these meta-analyses varied with the methods employed, the 
						studies included, and the addition of later trials.	</li><br>
						
					<li> <b>Emerging Data</b><br>
						The controversy surrounding the rosiglitazone meta-analysis authored by Nissen and Wolski 
						forced an unplanned interim analysis of a long-term, randomized trial investigating the 
						CV effects of rosiglitazone among patients with type 2 diabetes. The authors of the 
						RECORD trial noted that even though the follow-up at 3.75 years was shorter than expected, 
						rosiglitazone, when added to standard glucose-lowering therapy, was found to be associated 
						with an increase in the risk of heart failure but was not associated with any increase in 
						death from CV or other causes. Data at the time were found to be insufficient to determine 
						the effect of rosiglitazone on an increase in the risk of MI. the final report of that trial, 
						published in June 2009, confirmed the elevated risk of heart failure in people with type 
						2 diabetes treated with rosiglitazone in addition to glucose-lowering drugs, but continued 
						to show inconclusive results about the effect of the drug therapy on the risk of MI. 
						Further, the RECORD trial clarified that rosiglitazone does not result in an increased risk of 
						CV morbidity or mortality compared to standard glucose-lowering drugs. Other trials 
						conducted since the publishing of the meta-analysis have corroborated these results, 
						casting further doubt on the findings of the meta-analysis published by Nissen and Wolski.
						</li><br>
						
					<li> <b>Now what?</b><br>
						Some sources suggest that the original Nissen meta-analysis delivered more harm than benefit, 
						and that a well-recognized medical journal may have erred in its process of peer review. 
						Despite this criticism, it is important to note that subsequent publications support the 
						risk of adverse CV events associated with rosiglitazone, although rosiglitazone use does 
						not appear to increase deaths. These results and emerging data point to the need for further 
						rigorous research to clarify the benefits and risks of rosiglitazone on a variety of outcomes, 
						and the importance of directing the drug to the population that will maximally benefit from 
						its use.
						</li><br>
					
					<li> <b>Lessons Learned From this case Study</b><br>
						Results from initial randomized trials that seem definitive at one time may not be conclusive, 
						as further trials may emerge to clarify, redirect, or negate previously accepted results. 
						A meta-analysis of those trials can lead to varying results based upon the timing of the 
						analysis and the choices made in its performance.
						</li><br>
					
					<li> <b>Meta-Analysis: Tips for CER Practitioners</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li> The results of a meta-analysis are highly dependent on the studies included 
								(and excluded). Are these criteria properly defined and relevant to the purposes of 
								the meta-analysis? Were the combined studies sufficiently similar? Can results from 
								this cohort be generalized to other populations of interest?</li>
							<li> The statistical methodology can impact study results. Have there been reviews 
								critiquing the methods used in the meta-analysis?</li>
							<li> A variety of statistical tests should be considered, and perhaps reported, in the 
								analysis of results. Do the authors mention their rationale in choosing a statistical 
								method? Do they show the stability of their results across a spectrum of analytical
								 methods?</li>
							<li> Nothing is permanent. Emerging data may change the playing field, and meta-analysis 
								results are only as good as the data and statistics from which they are derived.
