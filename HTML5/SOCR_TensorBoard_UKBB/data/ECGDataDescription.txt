SOCR Longitudinal data - human electrocardiogram (ECG) signals

This ECG data structure represents a 2D array [1:162, 1:65536]. 
Each row [1:162, ] is an ECG recording representing 65536 temproral measurements over a period of 512 seconds, sampled at 128 Hz.

The 162 ECG recordings come from PhysioNet databases MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database [https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/], MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database [https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/nsrdb/],and BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database [https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/chfdb/].

The Labels file represents a vector of 162 diagnostic labels, one for each row of Data. The three diagnostic categories are: 'ARR', 'CHF', and 'NSR'. 

Labels:
ARR: 96 recordings from persons with arrhythmia.
CHF: 30 recordings from persons with congestive heart failure.
NSR 36 recordings from persons with normal sinus rhythms. 

Research Goal: Train a classifier to distinguish between the 3 clinical phenotypes: ARR, CHF, and NSR.
